# Project Proposal

We are building an AI-powered cursor extension for Google Calendar. The extension will allow users to schedule events and tasks, while also getting tips and advice on creating an optimized schedule from a chat feature.

## Functional Requirements

### General Features

-Create an account and sign in (through GitHub)
-Sorting events/tasks based on priority
-Connect with a user's Google Calendar
-Display a chat panel to chat with the AI

The following features could be implemented, if time permits:
-Event/task templates
-Event/task tags
-Push notifications

The following features would be nice to have but won't be implemented:

-Integration with other calendars: Apple, Microsoft

### AI Features

-Create events/tasks in your schedule
-Edit events/tasks in your schedule (time, day, title, color-code, etc.)
-Resolve schedule conflicts
-Offer suggestions on how to schedule your day/week
-Schedule group meetings, having the assistant read the schedules of multiple people in a group and suggesting a time to meet. If everyone accepts the suggestion, it will get added to their calendars.
The AI can analyze deadlines, task importance, and past user behavior to suggest an optimal order for completing tasks.
-Converse with an AI assistant through chat that can:
-Take in natural language such as “I am not a morning person, how can I schedule my afternoon for the following events…” and schedule accordingly
-Offer good scheduling practices to the user

The following features could be implemented, if time permits:

-Provide analytics on how much time you devote to certain tasks/events

The following features would be nice to have but won’t be implemented:

-Join meetings and assist user by taking notes
