# Project Proposal

We are building an AI-powered cursor-like extension for Google Calendar. The extension will allow users to schedule events and tasks, while also getting tips and advice on creating an optimized schedule from a chat feature.

## Functional Requirements

### Primary Features (Must Have)

As a user, I want to:
1. Create an account and sign in using Google so that I can securely access my calendar and scheduling features
2. Connect my Google Calendar to the application so that I can synchronize my events and tasks seamlessly
3. See a visual display of my Google Calendar within the application so that I can manage my schedule efficiently
4. Create, update, delete, and retrieve calendar events and tasks so that I can manage my schedule flexibly
5. Have a chat panel where I can interact with the AI to manage my schedule more efficiently
6. Create events and tasks using the chatbot so that I can schedule items efficiently, with an option to accept or decline before they are added
7. Edit events and tasks through the chatbot by modifying details like time, day, title, and color, with an option to accept or decline changes before they are applied
8. Resolve schedule conflicts by having the chatbot reschedule existing events when something new comes up so that I don’t have overlapping commitments
9. Create groups of people who need to meet as a team, allowing the chatbot to access general availability of members while keeping private details secure
10. Schedule group meetings by analyzing team members' calendars and suggesting a time that works for everyone, with an option for all members to accept before adding it to their schedules
11. Chat with the AI that can take natural language input, such as “I am not a morning person, how can I schedule my afternoon for the following events…” and adjust my schedule accordingly
    

### Secondary Features (Should Have)

As a user, I want to:
1. Sort my events and tasks based on priority so that I can focus on the most important tasks first
2. Have the AI analyze my deadlines, task importance, and past behavior so that it can suggest the best order for completing my tasks
3. Have the AI to provide best practices for scheduling so that I can optimize my time management
4. Have the AI suggest how to schedule my day or week so that I can manage my time effectively


### Tertiary Features (Nice to Have)

As a user, I want to:
1. Create event and task templates so that I can quickly add commonly scheduled activities without re-entering details
2. Categorize events and tasks using tags so that I can filter and organize them easily
3. Receive push notifications for upcoming events and tasks so that I don’t miss important commitments
4. Receive analytics on how much time I spend on certain tasks and events so that I can optimize my scheduling habits
5. Have the AI to analyze my deadlines, task importance, and past user behavior to suggest an optimal order for completing tasks
6. Have the option to switch between different AI models (OpenAI and Ollama) so that I can choose the assistant that best fits my needs

### Won't Have Features

As a user, I want to:
1. Integrate calendars from Apple and Microsoft so that I can manage all my schedules in one place
2. Have the AI to join my meetings and take notes so that I can focus on discussions without worrying about documentation

### Tech Stack

Frontend: Vite, React.js, 
Backend: Convex 
APIs: Google Calendar API, OpenAI, Ollama(if time permits)
