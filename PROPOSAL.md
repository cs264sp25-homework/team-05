# Project Proposal


## Functional Requirements


### General Features


### AI Features

Create events/tasks in your schedule
Edit events/tasks in your schedule (time, day, title, color-code, etc.)
Resolve schedule conflicts
Offer suggestions on how to schedule your day/week
Schedule group meetings, having the assistant read the schedules of multiple people in a group and suggesting a time to meet. If everyone accepts the suggestion, it will get added to their calendars. 
The AI can analyze deadlines, task importance, and past user behavior to suggest an optimal order for completing tasks.
Converse with an AI assistant through chat that can:
Take in natural language such as “I am not a morning person, how can I schedule my afternoon for the following events…” and schedule accordingly
Offer good scheduling practices to the user

The following features could be implemented, if time permits: 

Provide analytics on how much time you devote to certain tasks/events

The following features would be nice to have but won’t be implemented: 

Join meetings and assist user by taking notes
